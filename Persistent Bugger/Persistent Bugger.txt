Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example (Input -- Output)

39 -- 3 (because 39 = 27, 27 = 14, 14 = 4 and 4 has only one digit, there are 3 multiplications)
999 -- 4 (because 999 = 729, 729 = 126, 126 = 12, and finally 12 = 2, there are 4 multiplications)
4 -- 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number, there is no multiplication)
